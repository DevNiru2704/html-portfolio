    <p>
      Hello guys, I am Nirmalya Mandal. As of 26th October 2023, I am a beginner web developer. This is my first project that I managed to do
      by myself. This project is basically a portfolio where it shows the number of projects that I made when I just started to learn HTML.
      Oh! And another thing...Dont bother trying to contact me using phone number, email or any other address that I have given. Its all fake.
      As a student, I value privacy the most. I have given the details for the sake of giving the details.
